<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">80 years old</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I joined this course to bring my IT knowledge up to date<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Previous work experience:</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">IBM NZ 30 years</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">3 years computer analyst/programmer</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">22 years in middle management levels managing various groups of analyst/programmers, marketing support personnel, and marketing representatives.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">5 years project manager working for IBM at various customer venues around the world installing a Telecom Billing and Activation System.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Initially joined the IBM Service Bureau in Auckland where punched card sorters, tabulators and printers were being used to process customer data for the purpose of producing invoices, statements, and reports for customers. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My job consisted of wiring electric panels to process the cards that had been punched in a predetermined format to obtain the result required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Four months after joining IBM a 1401 computer with 12k of memory and 4 tape drives was installed in the Service Bureau and all the jobs had to be reprogrammed in Autocoder to utilise the new computer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The 1401 computer had a console to control it put no distributed terminals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The programs were loaded into the computer using punched cards as was the data, both of which could be stored on the tapes once loaded.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">After about 3 years the 1401 computer was replaced by a 360 computer and once again the programs were re-written in Cobol. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The 360 was a more powerful computer with more memory and disc drives as well as tape drives and with distributed terminals.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">As most employees now had terminals on their desks IBM introduced a messaging system called Profs. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was like the current Word application but was much earlier and only available to IBM employees when they were in the office.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I joined this course to bring myself up to date with where IT currently stands and to stimulate my thinking. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not seeking a job. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am very aware of our everyday use of IT through social media, personal computers, i-Pads, smart watches, mobile phones and electric cars and other items we use on a day-to-day basis, and I wanted to understand and think about this and the possible future.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">My project is very clear:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To get as much knowledge and stimulation as I can out of this course. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will largely be a result of the effort I put in, but it is also what assignments are set. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So far, I am very satisfied with the course and results I have obtained.</p>
